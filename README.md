A monitor is an electronic output device that is also known as a video display terminal (VDT) or a video display unit (VDU). It is used to display images, text, video, and graphics information generated by a connected computer via a computer's video card. Although it is almost like a TV, its resolution is much higher than a TV. The first computer monitor was introduced on 1 March 1973, which was part of the Xerox Alto computer system.

Older monitors were built by using a fluorescent screen and Cathode Ray Tube (CRT), which made them heavy and large in size and thus causing them to cover more space on the desk. Nowadays, all monitors are made up by using flat-panel display technology, commonly backlit with LEDs. These modern monitors take less space on the desk as compared to older CRT displays.

## Monitor Facts

The most popular brands of computer monitors include Acer, Hanns-G, Dell, LG Electronics, Sceptre, Samsung, HP, and AOC. You can purchase monitors from these manufacturers directly or through retailers like Amazon and Newegg.

A monitor usually connects to an HDMI, DVI, or VGA port. Other connectors include USB, DisplayPort, and Thunderbolt. Before investing in a new monitor to use with your computer, make sure both devices support the same type of connection.

For example, don't buy a monitor that has an HDMI port when your computer is only capable of accepting a VGA connection. Although most video cards and monitors have multiple ports to work with various kinds of devices, it's still important to check their compatibility.
